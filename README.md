_the classical music manager for which you've waited a lifetime._

`clamm` is a tool for managing a library of classical music. For a brief discussion on what is meant by "classical", see

[1] 
By _classical_, I mean any piece of music characterized by having an associated 

o composer

o performer (artist)

o arrangement

Which, for my library, includes traditional classical composers, like [J.S. Bach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Sebastian\_Bach) and [Beethoven](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_van_Beethoven), as well as newer, harder to categorize composers, like [Max Richter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Richter) and [Steve Reich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Reich).
