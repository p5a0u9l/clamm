# clamm

_the classical music manager you never knew you needed, until now..._

`clamm` is a python program for managing a library of classical music. For a brief discussion on what is meant by "classical", see NOTES, below. 

`clamm` 

* efficiently maps the tags of classical music audio files to sane structures

* provides tools for working with raw audio streams of (you guessed it!) classical music

* generate playlists using iTunes-like combination logic. 

## NOTES

By _classical_, I mean any piece of music characterized by having an associated 

* composer

* performer (artist)

* arrangement

Which, for my library, includes traditional classical composers, like [J.S. Bach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Sebastian\_Bach) and [Beethoven](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_van_Beethoven), as well as newer, harder to categorize composers, like [Max Richter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Richter) and [Steve Reich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Reich).
