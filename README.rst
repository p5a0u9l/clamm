======

*the classical music manager you never knew you needed, until now...*

``clamm`` is a python program for managing a library of classical music. 

* efficiently maps the tags of classical music audio files to sane structures

* provides tools for working with raw audio streams of (you guessed it!) classical music

* generate playlists using iTunes-like combination logic.

.. _musicbrainz: https://musicbrainz.org/ database

1. There are already several good music library tools on the market. The best I am aware of is probably is beets_. ``beets`` has great support for interfacing with the open-source tag database musicbrainz_ as well a host of library management functionality and a rich plugin ecosphere. Indeed, ``clamm`` aspires to be like ``beets`` when it grows up.
