============

*the classical music manager you never knew you needed, until now...*

``clamm`` is a python program for managing a library of classical music. For a brief discussion on what is meant by "classical", see NOTES, below. 

``clamm`` 

* efficiently maps the tags of classical music audio files to sane structures

* provides tools for working with raw audio streams of (you guessed it!) classical music

* generate playlists using iTunes-like combination logic.
