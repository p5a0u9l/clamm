notes
=====

By *classical*, I mean any piece of music characterized by having an associated 

* composer

* performer (artist)

* arrangement

Which, for my library, includes traditional classical composers, like 
`J.S. Bach<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Sebastian\_Bach>` and 
`Beethoven<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_van_Beethoven>`, as well as 
newer, harder to categorize composers, like 
`Max Richter<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Richter>` and 
`Steve Reich<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Reich>`.
