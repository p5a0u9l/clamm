notes
=====

By *classical*, I mean any piece of music characterized by having an associated 

* composer

* performer (artist)

* arrangement

.. _`J.S. Bach`: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Sebastian\_Bach
.. _`Beethoven`: https://enorg/wiki/Ludwig_van_Beethoven
.. _`Max Richter`: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Richter
.. _`Steve Reich`: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Reich

Which, for my library, includes traditional classical composers, like `J.S. Bach`_ and `Beethoven`_, as well as newer, harder to categorize composers, like `Max Richter`_ and `Steve Reich`_.
